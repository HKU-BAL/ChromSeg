# ChromSeg
A Two stage framework for crossing-overlap chromosome segmentation
  Stage 1 use region-guided UNet++ to localize and segment crossing-overlap regions for chromosomes clusters.
  Stage 2 use crossing-partition algorithm to splice and reconstruct non-overlap parts and crossing-overlap parts.
